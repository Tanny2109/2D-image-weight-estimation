## 2D Image Weight Estimation

This website uses 2D images captured from any device like a mobile phone, etc to predict weight of the food item along with other information like calories, fat, carbs, protein, calcium, iron.

### Dataset Collection
Dataset was collected in Georgia Tech's Dining halls (both Nav and Willage) by capturing approx. 70-80 overlaping images covering 360 degrees view of the food item and using Structure from Motion to generate a 3D pointcloud.
